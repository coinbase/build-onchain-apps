# Code of Conduct for Build Onchain Apps

## 1. Purpose

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. The primary goal is to create a safe and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion.

## 2. Expected Behavior

We expect all community members to:

- Exercise empathy and kindness towards other community members.
- Avoid using offensive or derogatory language.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.
- Focus on what is best for the community as a whole.

## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated and includes:

- Harassment or discrimination based on age, gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, or religion.
- Use of derogatory, discriminatory, or explicit language.
- Personal attacks or intimidation.
- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## 4. Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by opening a support ticket in the [Base Discord](https://base.org/discord). All reports will be handled with discretion.

## 5. Consequences for Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including project owners and maintainers, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the project maintainers may take action they deem appropriate, including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## 6. Scope
